# Selenium-on-Amazon
This repository showcases my automation testing capabilities with Cucumber, Selenium and TestNG in the Java programming language. 

It is an ongoing work in progress.

Next task to do: 
- Finish writing 'add product' and 'remove product' test cases in 'ProductDetailsPage.java' and 'CartPage.java'

Test Cases Automated:
- Valid login
- Invalid login
- Search product
- View product details

To run the program, execute 'RunAll.java' in Eclipse as a 'Java Application'.
