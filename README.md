# Selenium-on-Amazon
This repository showcases my automation testing capabilities with Cucumber, Selenium and TestNG in the Java programming language. 

It is an ongoing work in progress.

Current task: 
- Program parallel execution to execute multiple test cases at the same time by completing below tasks
- Create LoginTest, SearchTest and CartTest runner classes
- Create RunAllParallel runner class to run the above classes in parallel

Test Cases Automated:
- Valid login
- Invalid login
- Search product
- View product details
- Add product to cart
- Remove product from cart

To run the program, execute 'RunAll.java' in Eclipse as a 'Java Application'.
