# Selenium-on-Amazon
This repository showcases my automation testing capabilities with Cucumber, Selenium and TestNG in the Java programming language. 

It is an ongoing work in progress.

Next task to do: 
- Create 'cart-functionality.feature'
- Create 'ProductDetails.java' POM
- Add test case for 'Add product to cart' in 'cart-functionality.feature' and 'ProductDetails.java'

Test Cases Automated:
- Valid login
- Invalid login
- Search product
- View product details

To run the program, execute 'RunAll.java' in Eclipse as a 'Java Application'.
